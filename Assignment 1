#1. Get the inputs 
#    1.1 Get school hour input
SchoolStartHour = eval(input("Please enter the hour school starts"))
#    1.2 Get school minute input
SchoolStartMinute = eval(input("Please enter the minute school starts"))
#    1.3 Convert school start time into minutes
SchoolStartTime = SchoolStartHour * 60 + SchoolStartMinute
#    print(SchoolStartTime)

#    1.4 Get the inputs of the stop number
StopNumber = eval(input("Please enter your stop number"))
#    1.5 Print stop number to check that expression is correct
#    print(StopNumber)

#2. calculate arrival time
#    2.1 Calculate arrival time of the first stop
FirstStopArrivalTime = SchoolStartTime - 45
#    2.2 Calculate arrival time for user inputed stop
InputStopArrivalTimeMinutes = (StopNumber-1) * (3+2)
InputStopArrivalTime = (InputStopArrivalTimeMinutes + SchoolStartTime)//60
#    2.3 Calculate departure time for inputed stop
InputStopDepartureMinutes = (InputStopArrivalTimeMinutes + SchoolStartTime)%60
#    2.4 Calculate stop wait time
StopWaitingPeriod = InputStopDepartureMinutes + 2
#    2.5 Print calculations to check that the numbers are correct
#    print(InputStopArrivalTime)
#    print(FinalStopMinutes)
#    print(StopWaitingPeriod)

#3. Output responses from inputs
#    3.1 Show the arrival and departure time for the inputed stop number
ArrivalandDepartureTime = "The bus will be at stop number " + str(StopNumber) + " between " + str(SchoolStartHour) + ":" + str(InputStopDepartureMinutes) + " and " + str(SchoolStartHour) + ":" + str(StopWaitingPeriod)
print(ArrivalandDepartureTime)

#    3.2Calculate time remaining to school
TripTimeRemaining = (45-InputStopArrivalTimeMinutes) - 2
#    3.3 Check calculation by printing TripTimeRemaining
#    print(TripTimeRemaining)
#    3.4 Show the length of the trip
TripLength = "The length of of the trip from stop number " + str(StopNumber) + " is " + str(TripTimeRemaining) +  " minutes"
print(TripLength)
#    3.5 Calculates ticket cost
TicketCost = ((TripTimeRemaining//4)*15+100)/100
#    3.6 Print TicketCost to check calculation
#    print(TicketCost)
#    3.7 Show the price of the ticket
TripPrice = "The cost of the ticket from stop number " + str(StopNumber) + " is $" + str(TicketCost)
print(TripPrice)
